# Python IOTA Workshop

Some simple examples to get you started on developing with IOTA using Python.


### Getting started

Python 3 and `pip` are required to run these examples. It is highly recommended 
to run these examples in a own Python virtual environment.

To start playing with these examples run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iota-community/python-iota-workshop.git
cd python iota-workshop
pip install -r requirements.txt
python code/01_hello_world.py
```

You should receive a message including the statistics of an IOTA node. This means you can explore and run the other examples.


### Examples included

Here are the examples included:


 - `01_hello_world.py`
 - `02_send_hello.py`
 - `03_receive_hello.py`
 - `04_generate_address.py`
 - `05_check_balance.py`
 - `06_send_tokens.py`
 - `07_send_data.py`
 - `08_receive_data.py`
 - `09_zmq_listen.py`


### Work to be done:

- Add more complex application examples
