# Python IOTA Workshop

Some simple examples to get you started on developing with IOTA using Python.

### Try before you buy

You can try out these examples to see how they work without needing a local installation on:
https://repl.it/@Davede/Python-IOTA-Workshop


### Getting started

Python 3 and `pip` are required to run these examples. It is highly recommended 
to run these examples in a own Python virtual environment.

To start playing with these examples run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iota-community/python-iota-workshop.git
cd python iota-workshop
pip install -r requirements.txt
python code/e01_hello_world.py
```

You should receive a message including the statistics of an IOTA node. This means you can explore and run the other examples.


### Examples included

Here are the examples included:


 - `e01_hello_world.py`
 - `e02_send_hello.py`
 - `e03_receive_hello.py`
 - `e04_generate_address.py`
 - `e05_check_balance.py`
 - `e06_send_tokens.py`
 - `e07_send_data.py`
 - `e08_receive_data.py`
 - `e09_zmq_listen.py`


### Work to be done:

- Add more complex application examples
